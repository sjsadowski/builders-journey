# Building my new K3s homelab

## Background

Recently I've felt out of touch with the things going on in the world of containerization. I advocated for my employer
to join the [CNCF](), which they did, and have sent people on my team to CloudNativeCon/LinuxCon. A good number of my
team are [CKA]() and/or [CKAD]() certified.

Unfortunately for my techie-side, my role requires me to be strategic and manage people, which I find great contentment doing,
but that leaves very little time for

I'm not including the cost of the rack, or the other switches, the gateway/router, or the cable connection, because those are things I'd have
used no matter what (and I already had them)

## Imaging - OS Base

All machines use

## Software Decisions

### microk8s vs k3s vs k0s vs minikube

First things first - I'm not evaluating anything that runs in, requires, or necessitates docker in any way. If I were doing that,
[Docker Swarm Mode]() would be my preference due to integration and ease of use within that ecosystem. I'm not - I'm going the
pure k8s route. So Kind, k3d, and similar tooling is out of scope.

### storage

This is a clustered configuration and the applications will need to access storage throughout the cluster - unlike single-node
setups, the storage needs to be accessible from any node on the cluster, and any container in any pod. There's several
different options


### networking

### Quality of Life (QoL) software
