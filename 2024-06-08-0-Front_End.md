# Front End Web Development

In 1993, I got my first job (at age 14) with a local bulletin board service that had just started offering access to this crazy thing called the internet. My job duties were never very clearly defined, and basically just ran the full range of anything that my boss could put me to work doing. I didn't have a real title, but we eventually settled on User Administrator, which was probably 50% of what I did: Creating new users, helping them get their internet connection set up and installed, troubleshooting, and sometimes shutting down or closing accounts.

But I was also responsible for assisting with troubleshooting (on the ISP side) the modem banks and the dedicated telco circuits as well as keeping the website up-to-date. This was my first experience with web development.
