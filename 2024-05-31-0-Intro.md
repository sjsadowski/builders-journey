# The Builder's Journey

Every few years I decide I need a new project. Sometimes they're valuable, like redoing my home network for better wifi speeds and coverage, and sometimes they're just tinkering like playing with the capabilities of a Raspberry Pi Zero W.

Lately I realized I needed to rework sjsadowski.com, partially because it was one of those 'useful' projects where I taught myself Svelte (and became enamored by it for front-end work) and Svelte has come quite a ways since the SvelteKit pre-GA release that I used, and partially because I keep writing articles/posts and not publishing them because I never quite got that part over the finish line. The articles that exist are there as conversions from an older ghost site (before they went the way of... whatever way it was) for the most part, and so I have a ton of content that's just getting stale.

I also thought it would be a great way to review some of the issues I have with 'full-stack developers' both as a claim by a developer, but also as a job role from an employer perspective.

## Everybody's Bad at Something

With the rise of MAANA (Or FAANG, if you prefer, still) and the glory and glitz of unicorn startups, one of the huge ways we've shot ourselves collectively in the foot in my opinion is the expectation that every developer should be some sort of genius polymath that can code like a 10x developer, understand both structured (RDBMS) data and unstructured (document/datalake) data schemas and utilization, define, build, and support infrastructure for both the applications and the data layers, implement good security at all levels, teach, share, review, and market the product they're working on, and never, ever, ever burn out.

In interviews as I've said before, I like to ask the question "What are you bad at?" because everyone has at least one thing they don't excel at. It doesn't have to be technical; it could be that someone's bad at presenting things, or that they're horrible with social interaction. It could be technical, though, like normalization or code reviews. Or it could be straight up that someone just can't wrap their head around a language or process. The point is that everyone has strengths and weaknesses both personally and professionally, and that's not a bad thing.

## What Am I Bad At Now?

I haven't done much in the way of technical retrospection in the past few years. Primarily I've been focused on my role of leading a team of very intelligent engineers and helping my employer grow the business. I spend much of my workday knee-deep in the quicksand of AWS consulting and people management and not very much time (or not as much as I'd like) doing technical work.

This leads me to broad goal: figure out my current technical strengths and weaknesses by building and extending my personal site (where you're probably reading this, if not in a feed reader).

## What Are the Test Areas?

- Web Development
  - Front-end
    - HTML5/CSS3/Svelte4 (maybe 5)
  - Back-end
    - Python APIs
    - PostgreSQL DB
- Mobile App Dev
  - NativeScript Svelte
    - iOS
    - Android
- Infrastructure
  - Kubernetes (on prem)
    - Python APIs deployed here
  - Site-to-Site VPN
    - Gateway for k8s
  - CDN configuration for static assets
- CI/CD
  - Pipelines for Infra
  - Pipelines for front-end deployment
  - Pipelines for back-end deployment

## Wrapping It Up

So there we have it, a broad outline of what I'm going to attempt in the summer of 2024. I also intend to catalog my progress, writing up my successess and failures and sharing my opinion on the state of the various technologies I'm using.
