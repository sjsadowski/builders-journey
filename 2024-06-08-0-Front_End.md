# Front End Web Development with Svelte 4

In 1993, I got my first job (at age 14) with a local [bulletin board system](https://www.wired.com/story/internet-origin-story-bbs/) that had just started offering access to this crazy thing called the internet. My job duties were never very clearly defined, and basically just ran the full range of anything that my boss could put me to work doing. I didn't have a real title, but we eventually settled on User Administrator, which was probably 50% of what I did: Creating new users, helping them get their internet connection set up and installed, troubleshooting, and sometimes shutting down or closing accounts.

During this time I was also responsible for assisting with troubleshooting (on the ISP side) the modem banks and the dedicated telco circuits as well as keeping the [website up-to-date](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/webmaster). This was my first experience with web development.

## The Terrible Trials of Early HTML

In the interest of looking backward, I spent time digging through old technology, specifically some [iomega zip disks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_drive) hunting for one of my early [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities) sites. Unfortunately none of my zip disks were readable - curse you, bit rot! - but I remember trying to do all sorts of things, including trying to figure out the perfect exact position so that I could recreate the effect of finding the little **&pi;** symbol displayed in the unfortunate Sandra Bullock 1995 feature ["The Net"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Net_(1995_film)), but unfortunately [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) was still years away from being useful.

Blink elements, awful positioning efforts using the only available option (tables), and page cycling for form submissions were the options at the time, and they made for a tedious experience compared to things like [AOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL) that had client providing a more seemless user experience.

## Frameworks, Frameworks, and More Frameworks

I really debated going framework zero with this project. I have previously used react, vue, and of course jquery back in the day. Interestingly, these all serve different needs. What I was looking for was something with which I could easily start moving, and the last iteration of the site used SvelteKit (pre-1.0) with Svelte 1.x. After wondering if I should try something new, or just straight HTML5/CSS3/ECMAScript 2023.

After some though and looking at other frameworks like Astro and HTMX, I decided just to version bump for Svelte/SvelteKit. There were enough changes between the versions when I originally converted the site to Svelte in 2022 til now (June 2024) to make that more than enough to take on for now in my opinion.
